# segment-tree
Implemented segment tree with lazy tag, maintaining maximum interval, minimum interval, interval sum, and interval product.(Interval product does not have lazy tag function.)
I use visual basic to.

This tool provides a visual interface by Visual Basic. It introduces the concept of segment trees and their associated functions. Additionally, it links to a C++ executable file to handle the core segment tree operations efficiently.

## note
Visual basic is not a necessary component, you can use C++ alone if necessary.

# Features
- Segment Tree Construction: The tool constructs a segment tree based on the input data provided by the user.
- Segment Updates: Users can update individual segments within the segment tree.
- Modifications: Users can modify single points or within a specified range by adding a certain value to each segment.
- Maximum Value Query: Users can query for the maximum value within a specified range of segments.
- Minimum Value Query: Users can query for the minimum value within a specified range of segments.
- Interval Sum Query: Users can query for the sum of values within a specified range of segments.
- Interval Product Query: Users can query for the product of values within a specified range of segments.

# Prerequisites
- Visual Basic
- C++ Standard Library:C++11 or higher is recommended.
- Windows.h
  
# Usage
1. Input Data: Provide the number of segments and the values of each segment.
2. choose functions:
  U: Update a single segment by specifying the segment number and its new value.
  K: Modify segments within a range by specifying the range and the value to add.
  H: Query for the maximum value within a specified range.
  L: Query for the minimum value within a specified range.
  F: Query for the sum of values within a specified range.
  M: Query for the product of values within a specified range.
3.Output: The tool will provide the result of each query or operation.
